Introduced how to create a class and use it --(this,new) keywords
we used some js provided classes (Map,Date)
'Promise' class 

Promise class gives u a promise that I will return some thing in the future.

setTimeout(fn,3000); //calls fn after 3000

//callback based approach (asysnc)

like Using a Date class is easy but declaring is difficult.

//defining is hard
//using  is difficult

//real world usage of promises.
